		number	= byte, short, int, long
		fraction number = float, double
		1 character = char
		group of characters = String
		Yes/no answer = boolean
		complex = create another program <anotherprogram> (has-a exercise)

 *********** Declaration rules ***********
	Declration line includes.... Data type followed by variable name
	variable cannot be assigned with a value before declaration a data type
	variable names : same program and same block
		u cannot have 2 similar variable names
		can contain alphabets, numbers, $, _
		start with alphabet or $ or _ 
		coding practice
			naming convention - camelCase
			choose a relevant meaningful names
	
	
******** initialization rules ****
	Value assigned to a variable for the FIRST time.
	values should match the data type on LHS
	RHS can be literal value or variable of same type


Methods :
	********* Method Declaration	*********
		how to recognize methods : Does-A exercise
		how to code methods :
			What to name this activity ??? <<NAME>>
			how many inputs are required ??? what are the data type of each inputs ???
			how many outputs are required ??? what is the data type of each output ???
		
		PUBLIC 	OUTPUT 	NAME	(INPUT)
	
	
		NAME : similar rules as variables
			Follow camelCase format in method names
			Alphabets , numbers, $, _ allowed in method names
	
		OUTPUT : CAN ALWAYS BE 0 or 1 
			0 = void  ... 
				public  void hello(String message)
			1 = appropriate data type, int/boolean... 
				public int add(int a, int b)
			more than 1 = complex or multiple infor to return, create a class that contains all the output data
				public Profile display(String userid)
				
		INPUT : CAN ALWAYS BE 0 or MORE 
			0 = if no input require, leave it empty
				public int bye(  )
			1 = write the data type followed by variable name
				public void welcome(String greeting)
			More = if more than 1 input , separated by comma. data type followed by the name 
				public int add(int number1, int number2)

	
how to code methods :
	What to name this activity ??? addition

		2 inputs... int and int

		1 output.... int

********* Accessing Data and methods ********* 
	Methods job is to process data.. it could read or change information (global variable)
	Methods communicate with each other to accomplish task. such as 
		Car
			startcar() // has to communicate (method call) with startEngine()
			pumpFuel()
			startEngine() // has to communicate (method call) to pumpFuel(), then motors will call rotateWheel()
			rotateWheel()
		
	same program : direct access 
	outside program : accessed with reference to the program using dot operator



	***************** Method call Important ******************
	
	method call : programs communicate with each other through method calls.
		parameters receive values from the callee program (Pass by value)							
			callee				caller		
			int a	will be 10			passed x whose value was 10		
			int b	will be 20			passed y whose value was 20		
			String c	will be john			passed p whose value was john		
		If callee need primitive output							
			 you can rerurn a  variable (sum) of same type or literal value						
		If callee need complex/Object output							
			 you can pass variable of same type

	1) Pass input that match data type				x , y, p are int, int ,String as needed by callee program					
		If callee need primitive input - you can pass variable of same type or literal value								
		If callee need complex/Object input - you can pass variable of same type								
	2) Pass input in the same order				pass same order int,int,String as needed by calling program					
	3) pass equal amount of input				3 inputs are needed by add, caller program passes 3					
	4) handle return type/output from caller program in same type									
		add method returns "int"… Callee program stores output in "int" variable result								
										
	***************** Method call Important ******************
	

********* Scope of Data ********* 
	Data that is part of you or defines you - global
	Data that is provided to you by other - parameter
	Data that u hold on temprory basis - local
	
		
	
***************** operators ************
	
		= assignment operator
		LHS RHS same data type
		LHS ..... should always be variable
		RHS .... literal value, new, variable, method call , expression
		RHS if u have variable.... VALUE of RHS variable is assigned / overwritten on LHS variable
		
		arithemtic operators = numberd data type.. int long float etc
		equality operator = ANY data type
		
		is 10 equal to 20 = NO
		is 4.4 equal to 4.4 = YES
		is 30 not equal to 40 = YES
		is 30 not equal to 30 = NO
		
		
		AND =	&&	
		OR = 	||
		
		true AND true = true 
		true AND false = false
		false AND true = false
		false AND false = false
		
		
		true OR true = true 
		true OR false = true
		false OR true = true
		false OR false = false
		
		LHS and RHS should be boolean
		LHS and RHS can have = boolean literal value, boolean variable, 
			expression that gives boolean output (relational and eqaulity operator)
	
	
	multiple operators on same line
	
	
	
	1) brackets (  )
	2) * / %
	3) + -
	4) relational
	5) equality
	6) logical and or
	multiple operator at same level ... left to right
	
	
	( 2 * 3 + 4) + ( 3 - 1 + 2 / 2) - ( (3+4) * 10)
	( 6 + 4) + ( 3 - 1 + 2 / 2) - ( (3+4) * 10)
	10  + ( 3 - 1 + 2 / 2) - ( (3+4) * 10)
	10  + ( 3 - 1 + 1 ) - ( (3+4) * 10)
	10  + ( 2 + 1 ) - ( (3+4) * 10)
	10  + 3  - ( (3+4) * 10)
	10  + 3  - ( 7  * 10)
