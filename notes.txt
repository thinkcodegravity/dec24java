	Memory :   Binary language ( 1 , 0 )
Software 
	programs : take binary data from memory and provides Visual aspect

Concepts of prgramming style

	Procedure Oriented Programming : focus on task ( Machine level programming )
	C language
		takeOff/Fly : 

	Object Oriented Programming : focus on system ( User/ customer focused s/w)
	Java , Dotnet , Ruby , C++

			has 
				cockpit : life support system
					has 
						ventilaton :
						air supply :
						water system :
						
				fuel chamber : ignite the fuel
				exhaustion chamber : exhaute the gas/energy from buring fuel in downward
					direction

BankAccount
accountNumber, withdraw, pin , deposit, transfer, customer name, money, login

	// DATA or INFORMATION
	has - a ( BankAccount is MADE-OF or COMPOSED of below attributes)
		accountNumber=0000, pin=1234, customername=john,balance=100
	
	// PROCESS INFORMATION or DATA
	does -a ( BankAccount DOES following activity or PROVIDES following features)
		withdraw ( Logic) 
			25$.... is this customer balance greater than withdraw request
			if yes, then new balance=75...
			else insufficient fund error

******************* Variables ******************
Class members : components that make up your program

Requirement analysis 
BankAccount
	has-a : STORE information ( Variables )
		acctNumber=123  phone=123213 email=j@g.com lastname=asdsad firstname=ewewqeqwe
	
	does-a : MANIPULATE information (Methods)
		withdraw - 20
			money decrease
		deposit -40
			money increases
		update profile
			phone/email/name gets changes
		
		
Varies/Vary : changes
money ???? Variable name ( identifier-meta data ) info about info
120 ??? value (information)

variable name rules  : violation will cause errors
	should be unique in a program
	no spaces
	special characters = $ _ 
	character and numbers 
	should begin with alphabets or special character (not with number)
	Key words cannot be used
Code guidelines
	variable name should be appropriately named to its purpose
	if 2 worded varialbe name use camelcase
		upper case... lower case... camelcase

program with Variable
1) List the has-a 
2) find the category of each variable
3) pick appropriate java data type



******* requirement analysis *********
BankAccount
	has-a : STORE information ( Variables )
		acctNumber, phone , email ,lastname , firstname , address, balance, accountActive, 
		loggedIn
	does-a : MANIPULATE information (Methods)
		withdraw - 20

*********** design **********		
acctNumber = variable name (identifier)
123  	= value (information)
int = data type


	Simple information / primitive Data type
		numbered data = byte, short, int, long
			acctNumber, phone
		fraction data = float, double
			balance
		single character data - char
			loggedIn
		yes/no data - boolean
			accountActive
	
	Complex information / object Data type
		group of character data = String
			email,lastname=doe,firstname=john
		contain sub-information data = another program
			address = 
				street num, build num, city, state, zip, country
