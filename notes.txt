Programming concepts

Procedure oriented programming
	focus on the task
Object oriented programming
	focus on the system
	
Problem statement : Rocket fly	
	
Procedure oriented programming : expert
	focus on FLY
	
Real world problem or beginner

Object oriented programming - modular approach
	focus on Rocket
	
	Rocket 
		Has -A : propeller, combustion chamber, Fuel, cockpit
		
		Does-A : fly
					take fuel
					burn fuel in combustion chamber
					exhaust gas from propeller compoent
					
	
	BankAccount : accountNumber,routingnumber, withdraw,userid, deposit, id,password, balance, login, 
			applyLoan, pincode
	
		Store/Hold information
		HAS-A : accountNumber,routingnumber, userid,id,password,balance,pincode=5678
			
			pincode , enterPin
			
		Manipulate/changing/processing information
		DOES-A : withdraw (Action), deposit, login, applyLoan
	
	
	Memory : store information
	CPU : process information
	
	
	BankAccount : 
		
		Store/Hold information
		HAS-A : balance=1000
			
		Manipulate/changing/processing information
		DOES-A : 
			withdraw (10000$)
				if balance is greater than withdraw amount
					then balance minus withdraw amount
				or else if balance is less than withdraw amount
					low balance. cannot withdraw
					
	public class BankAccount{
		int balance=1000;
		
		public  void withdraw(int withdrawAmount){
			if(balance >= withdrawAmount)
				balance=balance-withdrawAmount;
			else
				sysout("low balance. cannot withdraw);
		}
	}

Analysis

BankAccount : accountNumber,routingnumber, withdraw,userid, deposit, id,password, balance, login, 
		applyLoan, pincode

	variable = vary various = changes
	Store/Hold information
	HAS-A : accountNumber,routingnumber, userid,id,password,balance,pincode=5678
	
	// variables hold information, that can change over the time.
	int balance=100; // balance is a varible.. variable
	
	method
	Manipulate/changing/processing information
	DOES-A : withdraw (Action), deposit, login, applyLoan
