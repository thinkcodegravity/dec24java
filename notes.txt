helps with programming , compilation and execution

programming - writing the source code
compilation - convert the source code into binary code
execution - use binary code to launch the software

if you create program with name "welcome"
source code : found in src folder, name of file is welcome.java
binary code : found in bin folder, name of file is welcome.class

reassignment



= assignment operator
LHS : Left Hand Side of equal sign
RHS : Right Hand Side of equal sign


LHS ALWAYS VARIABLE
RHS ALWAYS VALUE


int age = 10;
Rules
1) RHS value should match LHS data type
	int age=10; // YES
	int age="john"; // NO
2) LHS can always be variables (NO VALUES)
	10=int age;
3) RHS can have one of these
	3a can have matching value
	3b can have matching data type variable ( substitue with its value)
	3c can have expression ( solve expression on the right )
	
int x=10;
x=20;
int y=x; // int y=20;
int z=x + 30;	// int z=20 + 30;   int z=50;
sysout x y z	
	
	
	
asd= 10+20;
